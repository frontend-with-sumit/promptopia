Promptopia was developed as part of the NextJS course provided by JavaScript Mastery on YouTube. I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude to JavaScript Mastery for their comprehensive and well-structured course material, which served as the foundation for this project. Their course provided valuable insights and guidance on building NextJS applications and was instrumental in the development of Promptopia.

I highly recommend checking out the [NextJS course by JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk)if you are interested in learning more about NextJS and building powerful web applications.

I hope you enjoy using Promptopia and find it a valuable tool for generating meaningful responses with AI. Let your creativity flow and explore the endless possibilities with prompt-based generation. Happy prompting!
